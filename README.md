# HAPPY PROJECT

Group Project - 3 students, 2 weeks <br />
Made with @felikarina and @hanaevernon

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, our HAPPY PROJECT welcomes you with a home page that includes a banner where you can scroll through the 3 most trendy shows at the moment.
A trailer for each one will appear right below the banner.

Pushing the "Start the quiz" button presents you with 7 successive questions accompanied by compelling visuals. You'll be asked about movies, music artists and even your values.

Once we get a feel of what it is you like to watch, the code pulls data from the Jikan API to suggest the 5 highest-rated anime series of the genre you seem to most appreciate.
Along with the poster, the code displays a summary and the number of episodes to help you make your mind up.
